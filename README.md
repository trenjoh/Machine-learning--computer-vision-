Convolution Neural Networks-image classification using tensor flow

Trained the model from scratch,

The model classifies images of cats and dogs to their respective classes.

i HAVE also used matplotlib to be able to monitor the training of my model

Used text to speech, such that the Model can now actually what it predicted as the image is being displayed.

Works perfectly.

Keep in touch as i upgrade the model to something great.

Lets code together.
